# 📦 Data Cube and Multidimensional Operations

This project demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a **data cube** — a multidimensional array optimized for analytical queries. It includes practical implementations of fundamental data cube operations to facilitate complex data analysis.

## 🔍 What is a Data Cube?

A **data cube** organizes data in multiple dimensions, precomputing aggregated metrics (e.g., count of orders, total sales) to accelerate query performance. Instead of recalculating metrics for every query, these computations are stored for fast access.

## ⚙️ Key Data Cube Operations

1. **Roll-up**  
   Aggregates data along a dimension by grouping similar attributes.  
   *Example:* Summarizing daily income into monthly income for a customer.

2. **Drill-down**  
   The reverse of roll-up; breaks aggregated data into finer granularity.  
   *Example:* From country-level data for India, drilling down to states, then cities and villages.

3. **Slicing**  
   Filters the cube to select data for a specific attribute in one dimension.  
   *Example:* Showing data only for the country "Jamaica".

4. **Dicing**  
   Extracts a sub-cube by selecting specific ranges or attributes across multiple dimensions.  
   *Example:* Viewing annual salary data for employees in Jharkhand state.

5. **Pivot**  
   Rotates the data cube’s viewpoint without changing data, swapping rows and columns to offer new perspectives.  
   *Example:* Changing analysis from Year vs Branch to Branch vs Item Type.

## 🛠 Project Implementation

- A 3D multidimensional array is constructed to represent the data cube with synthetic data values.  
- Each of the above operations is demonstrated through Python code examples operating on this cube.

## 🎯 Goals

- Design and understand multidimensional data models.  
- Apply and evaluate key data cube operations relevant to business intelligence and data warehousing scenarios.
